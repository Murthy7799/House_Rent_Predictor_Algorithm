# House_Rent_Predictor_Algorithm
This project predicts house prices for rent in one of the metropolitan cities(Hyderabad) in India. The data has been extracted from 99 acres.com by using a web scrapping method with a beautiful soup package in python. The extracted data will be formatted as a data frame and converted to a CSV file.   
Later we use data cleansing methods and prepare the data set for machine learning algorithms.

# How to execute this code
Either you can use any editor or use terminal
for terminal:
cd filelocation 
python3 filename.py

# Required packages to install
Pandas
beautiful soup

# Changes to be made in file 
Please update the file path according to your device to avoid error for creating a dataset with csv extension at the end of the code.

You can play around the code and make changes as you like.
