# House_Rent_Predictor_Algorithm
This project predicts house prices for rent in one of the metropolitan cities(Hyderabad) in India. The data has been extracted from 99 acres.com by using a web scrapping method with a beautiful soup package in python. The extracted data will be formatted as a data frame and converted to a CSV file.   
Later we use data cleansing methods and prepare the data set for machine learning algorithms.

# How to execute this code
Either you can use any editor or use terminal
for terminal:
cd filelocation 
python3 filename.py

# Required packages to install
Pandas
beautiful soup

# Changes to be made in file 
Please update the file path according to your device to avoid error for creating a dataset with csv extension at the end of the code.

You can play around the code and make changes as you like.

# Jupyter Notebook

Added jupyter notebook with the following steps in it
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Analysing the numerical data and creation of extra columns with numerical data
3. splitting the data set based on train test method
4. training the data with multiple regression algorithms
5. Linear Regression
6. Logistic regression
7. KNN Regressor
8. SVR Regressor
9. Random forest Regressor

I have added comments for evry peice of code and make as easy as possible to understand.

To run the jupyter file
pip3 install jupyter
run jupyter notebook command from terminal and access the downloaded file and check the code and execute.
